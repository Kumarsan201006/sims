This directory contains a few files used during the development of the SIMSReader class. It is especially useful in understanding the header layout. Columns of bytes were generated with the script bytes2csv.py. The CSV files were then imported into Numbers (iWork), where colour was added to indicate the different sections of the header. The numbers files were exported to OpenDocument Spreadsheet and PDF for anyone interested. The corresponding data files are in the test/files subdirectory.
