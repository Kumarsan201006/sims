TODO
====
 
- Limage output. See how Larry mangles the headers.
- Finish info/help system. Find out what the unknowns are.
- Find out what the unknown (red areas) in the headers are.

Future plans
============

- SIMS file writer. Maybe add our own section to the header in an empty area; sync ideas with Larry to keep compatibility between our program and Limage.
- Create a new dict-derived format with support for nested dicts. Or use a class with embedded variables. Whichever is easier to search.
