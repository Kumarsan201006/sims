=============

The file OpenMIMS.tar.bz2 contains a part of the OpenMIMS source tree (SVN rev 858 from https://zoomwhee.mgh.harvard.edu/svn_devel/OpenMIMS). OpenMIMS is a SIMS reader and analysis plugin for ImageJ and is written in Java. I've based most of the development of the sims package on information found in OpenMIMS, especially Opener.java and Mims_Reader.java (in OpenMIMS/trunk/source/com/nrims/data). The source code is copied here for reference. For more information on OpenMIMS, see http://nrims.harvard.edu/software.
